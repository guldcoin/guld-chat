#### [Sending guld and checking balance](http://guld.chat/3-transactions/3-Transfers.html) 

gai is also your personal bank teller.

You can request a "digital transaction slip" to sign, then submit to him, and he will register the transaction on your behalf to the guld ledger.

Sending a signed message to gai preceded by the command `/sub` will register a transaction into the guld ledger.

using the command `/send`, gai produces the ledger transaction format, that when signed, is recognized as a valid order from the signer.

The command `/send fromusername tousername 5` will produce the following transaction:

``` 
 2018/03/06 * transfer
    ; timestamp: 1520395322
    fromusername:Assets   -5 GULD
    fromusername:Expenses   5 GULD
    tousername:Assets   5 GULD
    tousername:Income   -5 GULD
``` 

Signing will produce a file that looks like the text below, that when sent with the `/sub` command, will be recorded by gai into the guld network.

``` 
/sub -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

2018/03/06 * transfer
